> Command-line application to create and manage data migration to Filecoin

The Filecoin Data Transfer Service (FTS) creates a queue of storage tasks based on local data and leverages the [Powergate](https://github.com/textileio/powergate) API to move data to deals on the Filecoin network. 

Textile connects and extends [Libp2p](https://libp2p.io/), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/). Three interoperable technologies makeup Textile:
